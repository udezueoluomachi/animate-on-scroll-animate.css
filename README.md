export default function Component() {
    const scrollElem = useRef(null)
    useAnimationOnScroll(scrollElem || null, {noRepeat : false})
    return (
        //add ref
        //specify the element which when it appears in the viewport triggers the animation
        //add animation-settings attributes to the elements to be animated.
        //Add animate__onscroll class to the classList of the element to be animated.
        <div ref={scrollElem}>
            <div className="animate-onscroll-trigger">
                <p animation-settings="animate__fadeInDown animate__slower" className="animate__onscroll" >
                    hello world
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

The value of the `animation-settings` attributes are to be the animate.css animaton classes except from and `animate__animated` class.

 ## Note

 I might not update this project in the future because of time. There are lot of features it could have. I am only publishing this because I do not want to keep on moving files just to use my code. I want to use via `npm install` instead. It is 3:23 am 4/11/2024. I need sleep. I have a project I am working on simultaneously. Happy coding. Made with ðŸ«¡. Bye for now. Please make a pull request.
